## What is Linatabara3?
Linatabara3 is "**لنتبرع**" written with latin alphabets, which is an Arabic word that means "**let's donate**".

Linatabara3 is an open source blood donation platform that connects blood seekers with blood donors in their region.

**I used Laravel 9 and Bootstrap.**

## How it works?
- **For blood donors:** they register using their phone number, blood group, address...
- **For blood seekers:** they do a quick search where they choose the blood group and the region, then they will get a list of donors with their phone number.

**Here is a working demo:  https://linatabara3.com/**

## Just Arabic and French?
I created this platform to launch it first in Algeria (My country ❤) that's why I used Arabic and French (they are the most used languages in Algeria).
I also used Algerian Provinces and Districts.

**We welcome every contribution to make this platform dynamic and multinational.**
